# Drag and Drop To Do List

### Users can interact with the UI by dragging elements between lists â€” items can be moved from the 'To Do' list to the 'Done' list and vice versa.

Users can also reorder items within each list. All items initially start in the 'To Do' list with a dark red background colour. When an item is moved to the 'Done' list, its background colour changes to green. If an item is moved back to the 'To Do' list, its background colour reverts to dark red.
